----------

Pkzip structure provides access to PKZIP format.

Deflate structure is an implementation of Deflate (RFC 1951) decoder.

If you want to use just Deflate structure, use deflate.cm (for SML/NJ) or deflate.mlb (for MLton).
For Pkzip structure, use pkzip.cm or pkzip.mlb.
Also available from Smackage.
